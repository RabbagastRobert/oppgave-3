        During the last 80 years or so, mankind has sent many probes to learn more about the planets in our solar
        system.
        Some of witch are travelling so fast that they are able to escape the gravity of our sun and begin their
        interstellar
        journeys.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this article we will have a look at the 5 most distant of these probes and how far they've gone.

          <h2>New Horizons</h2>
          <p>
            Launched January 19th, 2006, New Horizons is the 5th most distant object launched from Earth.
            It's primary mission was to study Pluto and at least one more Kuiper belt object.
          </p>
          <p>
            New Horizons was launched on an Atlas V rocket, and at the time it was the fastest object launched from
            Earth with a speed measuring 58.500 km/h.
            (a record that has been vastly beaten by the
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parker_Solar_Probe" target="_blank">
              Parker Solar Probe
            </a> in 2023)
          </p>
          <p>
            After a flyby and a gravity assist by Jupiter in 2007, New Horizons set the course for Pluto where it
            arrived in 2015.
            By then it was travelling at a stunning speed of 84.000 km/h at a distance of 12.500 km. It took the most
            detailed images
            of Pluto to this day.
          </p>
          <p>
            The probe is now flying through the Kuiper belt, and is expected to exit the belt in 2028 / 2029.
            Unfortunatly, New Horizons,
            is planned to be shut down before then because of budget cuts at NASA.
          </p>
          <p>
            New Horizons is as of September 2025, 9.2 billion km from Earth. That is the same as 62.2 AU. It has no
            final destination and is believed to orbit the galaxy forever. Right now it is heading in the direction of
            the
            Saggitarius constellation.
          <p>
            1 AU (Astronomical Unit) = 149.597.871 km = 8.3 light minutes = about the average distance between the Sun
            and Earth, however this has changed to be exactly 149.597.870.700 m as of 2012.

          <h2>Pioneer 11</h2>
          <p>
            Launched on an Atlas-Centaur rocket on april 6th, 1973, Pioneer 11 is the 4th most distant object to leave
            the Solar system. Its primary mission was to study Jupiter and Saturn, and also the solar wind and cosmic
            rays.
          </p>
          <p>
            Pioneer 11 started its flyby of Jupiter in december 1975 where it took detailed images of Jupiters Red Spot.
            It also gathered data and images of several of Jupiters moons; Callisto, Ganymede, Io, Europa and Amalthea.
          </p>
          <p>
            In late august 1979 it arrived at the Saturnian system. While there, it took pictures of Saturns rings while
            actually
            travelling through the rings. This was done to ensure that Voyager 2 could travel the same route through the
            rings
            without taking damage. Pioneer 11 was a true pioneer in that sense. This was done because the scientists
            thought it would
            be better to know ahead of time if it actually could be done. By doing this, two more moons was discovered
            sharing the
            same orbit. The probe nearly collided with one of them, travelling at a distance of only 4.000 km at the
            closest approach.
            Later, Pioneer 11 flew by Janus at a distance of only 2.500 km, however this was a planned encounter.
          </p>
          <p>
            Pioneer 11 had flybys of 13 out of the 274 moons of Saturn. Most of the moons around Saturn was not known at
            the
            time the probe visited the system.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 1990, Pioneer 11 travelled past the orbit of Pluto, and last contact with the probe was in November 1995.
          </p>
          <p>
            Its estimated distance is about 17,28 billion km from Earth or about 115,5 AU as of September 2025.
            It will pass the star

          <h2>Pioneer 10</h2>
          <p>
            Pioneer 10 was launched on March 3rd, 1972. Pioneer 10 was also launched with an Atlas-Centaur rocket.
            It was the first probe to travel beyond the asteroid belt and take pictures of Jupiter up close.
          </p>
          <p>
            It reached Jupiter in November 1973 and took about 500 pictures of the gas giant. While there it was
            discovered that
            the radiation from the planet was 10 times higher than previously predicted, and it was feared that the
            probe wouldn't
            survive the encounter. However, the probe made it through, only loosing a few of the images it had taken.
          </p>
          <p>
            The last, very weak, signal was received on January 23rd, 2003.<br />
            Both Pioneer 10 and Pioneer 11 each carried a gold-anodized aluminum plaque depicting figures of
            a male and
            a female human, and also symbols showing the origin of the probe, should any intelligent alien species ever
            discover any of the probes.

          <h2>Voyager 2</h2>
          <p>
            Launched August 20th 1977, 16 days before Voyager 1 on a Titan III-Centaur rocket, Voyager 2 is the 2nd
            furthest probe to
            leave Earth.
          </p>
          <p>
            Its mission was to explore the outer planets and their moons; Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. After
            visiting the planets, it was also going to measure the suns heliosphere and find the boundary between out
            solar system and interstellar space.
          </p>
          <p>
            After visiting Jupiter and Saturn (1979 and 1981), Voyager 2 set it course towards Uranus.
            Reaching Uranus in 1985 it was the first (and only) probe to reach the first icy gas giant.
            It collected data and images from 5 of its 29 known moons before its closest approach to Uranus
          </p>
          <p>
            In 1989 after nearly 12 years of flight, Voyager 2 reached Neptune, the farthest known planet in our Solar
            system.
            While there it observed the planet and 4 of the 16 known moons, before heading into interstellar space.
          </p>
          <p>More than 40 years after being launched from Earth, it crossed the heliopause and was officially in
            interstellar space.
            In July 2023, Voyager 2 overtook Pioneer 10 as the second farthest spacecraft from the sun.
            In approximatly 2036, the probe will be out of range of the Deep Space Network, but is expected to
            not be able to power any of the instruments long before that.
          </p>
          <p>
            Voyager 2 isn't travelling towards any specific star, and is expected to eternally travel the Milky Way.
            By now, it is about 21 billion km, or 140.5 AU from Earth.

          <h2>Voyager 1</h2>
          <p>
            Voyager 1 was launched on September 5th, 1977 on the same type of rocket as Voyager 2. It is by far the
            farthest object
            launched from Earth, travelling at more that 1 AU (149.5 million km) per year further than Voyager 2.
          </p>
          <p>
            Voyager 1 explored Jupiter and Saturn, the same as Voyager 2. However, instead of travelling to Uranus and
            Neptune, it
            took a detailed flyby of Titan, Saturns largest moon. It reached Titan in November 1980. The next day it
            also took pictures
            and collected data about Mimas, Enceladus, Rhea, and Hyperion; Four of Saturns many moons.
          </p>
          <p>
            Voyager 1 overtook Voyager 2 already in December 1977, just 3 months after launch. It overtook Pioneer 10 in
            february 1998.
            In August 2012 it was confirmed to reach interstellar space.
          </p>
          <p>
            Voyager 1 and 2 each brought with them the famous Voyager Golden Record. A disc with recorded audio of
            greetings in 55
            different languages, several sounds of humans and animals, and also various music from different parts of
            the world.
            Several pictures, and even brainwave scans was also stored on the disc. On the surface of the disc, there
            was provided
            instructions for how to read the disc and also a map of how to find our Solar system.
          </p>
          <p>
            As of now, Voyager 1 has travelled a stunning 25.2 billion km, or 168.35 AU from Earth. In November 2026 it
            is expected to
            reach a distance of 1 light day (24 light hours) from Earth. 1 light year will take about 18.000 years.
